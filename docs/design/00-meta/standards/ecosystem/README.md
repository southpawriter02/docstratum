# Ecosystem Health Dimensions Index

> **Parent:** [standards/](../README.md)
> **Type:** DS-EH-* (Ecosystem Health Dimension)
> **Total Expected:** 5 dimensions

## Overview

Ecosystem health dimensions measure properties that only exist at the ecosystem level — they cannot be assessed by looking at a single file in isolation. Each dimension contributes independently to the aggregate EcosystemScore.

## Index

| DS Identifier | Dimension | Description | Status |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [DS-EH-COV](DS-EH-COV-coverage.md) | Coverage | Measures representation across all 11 canonical section categories | DRAFT |
| [DS-EH-CONS](DS-EH-CONS-consistency.md) | Consistency | Detects agreement on project name, version, and terminology across files | DRAFT |
| [DS-EH-COMP](DS-EH-COMP-completeness.md) | Completeness | Measures link resolution rate — every promise in the index leads to accessible content | DRAFT |
| [DS-EH-TOK](DS-EH-TOK-token-efficiency.md) | Token Efficiency | Ensures balanced token distribution across files (no single file >80% concentration) | DRAFT |
| [DS-EH-FRESH](DS-EH-FRESH-freshness.md) | Freshness | Measures version synchronization and temporal alignment across all ecosystem files | DRAFT |
